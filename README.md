Thanks for using it and sorry for not being able to continue this work.

### TypeScript typings for Waypoints

I missed TypeScript typings for [Waypoints](http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/) library.
Plugin author said he won't deliver it 
([see comment](https://github.com/imakewebthings/waypoints/issues/410#issuecomment-111875710)) thus I decided to write
it myself ;)

Here you'll find single file **waypoints.d.ts** which covers whole [Waypoints API](http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/api/waypoint/)

Thanks to [@Koloto](https://github.com/Koloto) this project was merged to [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped)
